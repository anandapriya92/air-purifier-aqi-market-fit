# üß© Problem Statement

### Project Title: Air Purifier Market Fit Research Using AQI Analytics

---

### üß≠ Background

India is currently facing a critical air quality crisis. According to global air quality reports, **14 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world** are located in India. This has led to a rise in public health issues such as asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses, affecting millions of citizens.

**AirPure Innovations**, a startup committed to solving air quality challenges, is in the early stages of designing a smart air purifier product. However, the team is unsure whether there is sufficient and sustainable market demand across Indian cities. They are seeking **data-driven guidance** to make informed decisions before investing in R&D and product development.

### üîç Problem Statement

The startup needs to analyze:

- Where and how **severe air pollution** is across India
- Which **pollutants** are most dominant and need to be filtered
- How air pollution **correlates with health outcomes**
- Which cities or states have the **highest demand potential** based on pollution, health, and population data
- How **EV adoption**, policies, and public behavior impact pollution trends
- What **features competitors offer**, and what innovations are missing in the current market

### üéØ Objective

Use **Power BI dashboarding** and real-world datasets (from AQI, health, EV, and population sources) to:

- Map **pollution severity** across India
- Analyze **health impacts** and disease outbreaks linked to poor air quality
- Identify **priority cities** for product launch
- Suggest **essential air purifier features** based on regional needs
- Provide **market segmentation** insights using population and AQI
- Recommend **policy-aligned R&D strategies** for AirPure Innovations
