# 🌫️ Air Purifier Market Fit Research Using AQI Analytics  
**📊 A Power BI Dashboard Project | In Collaboration with Dataful & Codebasics.io**

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Air pollution has become a critical public health crisis in India, with **14 Indian cities ranking among the world’s top 20 most polluted**. To address this, **AirPure Innovations**, a startup, is exploring the feasibility of launching a smart air purifier product.

Before investing in full-scale R&D and production, they need data-backed answers to essential questions:
- Where is the **demand highest**?
- What **features and pollutants** should the purifier target?
- What is the **health and behavioural impact** of air pollution?
- How can they differentiate from **existing competitors**?

This project provides an **end-to-end data analysis and interactive dashboard**, guiding strategic decisions for product-market fit using **AQI, health, vehicle, and population datasets**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The project is guided by three core dimensions of analysis, as emphasised by COO Tony Sharma:

1. **Severity Mapping**  
   → Identify areas with persistently high or worsening air quality.

2. **Health Impact Correlation**  
   → Analyze links between pollution levels and health outcomes across states.

3. **Demand Triggers & Market Fit**  
   → Discover how population, awareness, seasonality, and pollution spikes influence air purifier demand.

| Daily AQI Data | AQI levels, pollutants, and air quality status by area and date | `aqi.csv` |
| Health Illness Data | Disease outbreaks and illness counts per state | `idsp.csv` |
| Vehicle Registration Data | Fuel-type wise vehicle data, incl. EVs | `vahan.csv` |
| Population Projections | Monthly state-wise population by gender | `population_projection.csv` |
| Metadata | Schema and explanations for each dataset | `meta_data.txt` |
| External Research | Competitor features, policy impact, awareness (Google Trends, WHO) | `external_sources_notes.md` |
